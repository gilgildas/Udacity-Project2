    "First, we gathered the data by downloading \"twitter-archive-enhanced.csv\", using the request library to download \"image-predictions.tsv\", and downloading \"tweet-json.txt\" because we cannot access the Twitter API. After gathering three datasets we assessed datasets visually and programmatically. We found tidiness and quality issues which are highlighted below.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We have wrangled the three datasets and combined them before starting performing the data exploratory analysis. We found that the datasets have both tidyness and data quality issues.\n",
    "### Limitation\n",
    "However, we did not solve all issues in datasets because we don't have enough information about all columns. We didn't use the Twitter API to ddownload the tweet json dataset because they didn't give me the accesss."
